  <h3>A Star Is Born (dir. Bradley Cooper): </h3>
<p>
<span class="soundcite" data-id="580836180" data-start="128000" data-end="150000" data-plays="1">Tell me something, girl… </span> The most modern remake of A Star Is Born brings contemporary music festival vibes to the table. Throughout the film, Jackson (Bradley Cooper) remained consistent with his laid-back rock star look, always wearing denim with a t-shirt and occasionally, a jacket.
<br>
</br>
On the other hand, Ally (Lady Gaga) started out with a vintage, 70’s look but as she ascended toward fame, her clothes started shifting to a more sparkly popstar side. Costume designer, Erin Benach (Loving, Neon Demon), <a href="https://fashionista.com/2018/10/lady-gaga-a-star-is-born-outfits-hair-makeup"target="https://fashionista.com/2018/10/lady-gaga-a-star-is-born-outfits-hair-makeup">told Fashionista,</a> “We slowly go from seeing her in her Los Angeles city life and into Jack's world.”
<br>
</br>
Gaga’s high profile and connections made design houses almost beg to dress the lead. Some designers that got their pieces worn by Stefani were <a href="https://www.makioh.com/"target="https://www.makioh.com/">Maki Oh</a>with their ‘oh oh oh’ blue and yellow blouse, and Gucci custom made the sparkly yellow dress worn in the infamous and hard-to-watch Grammys scene.
<br>
</br>
And the Award for Best Outfit goes to…
<br>
</br>
Jack and Ally in this rock stars-in-love ensemble. I personally believe both these outfits perfectly sum up the vibe of the film and the characters. (Pssst, the leopard print pants are YSL).

<h3>The Favourite (dir. Yorgos Lanthimos):</h3>
<p>
In this stunning film, set in the <span class="soundcite" data-id="45143001" data-start="128000" data-end="150000" data-plays="1">early 18th century,</span>the costumes tell a tale of their own. The women in the film wore simple black and white gowns, with little makeup to break the stereotype that women were over-the-top with their clothing. The simplistic costumes also encourage the audience to focus on the complicated relationship between Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), and Abigail Masham (Emma Stone). While men wore chunky heels, extravagant wigs, and caked-on makeup, female characters like Sarah, relaxed with pants and her hair down.
<br>
</br>
Award-winning costume designer, Sandy Powell, has two nominations in her belt this year for Best Costume Design at the Academy Awards (The Favourite and Mary Poppins Returns). Powell told <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/sandy-powell-the-favourite-mary-poppins-returns/index.html"target="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/sandy-powell-the-favourite-mary-poppins-returns/index.html">CNN Style</a>, “I love color but on The Favourite, it would’ve been messy.” The monochrome looks blended with the set (a lavish palace and beautiful outdoors).
<br>
</br>
And the Award for Best Outfit goes to…
<br>
</br>
Sarah in this immaculate white and blue uniform. I have to admit; my mouth was left agape when she showed up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcmfV9Rd0A"target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcmfV9Rd0A">my screen</a> with this costume. From the embroidery to the color scheme and Weisz’s acting, this entire scene is flawless.

<h3>Black Panther (dir. Ryan Coogler):</h3>
<p>
The world’s favorite superhero just so happens to be the most stylish. Marvel’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/03/26/black-panther-more-box-office-milestones-as-soars-past-the-avengers/#17ff6b8261d3"target="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/03/26/black-panther-more-box-office-milestones-as-soars-past-the-avengers/#17ff6b8261d3">record breaking</a> <span class="soundcite" data-id="403728258" data-start="3000" data-end="15000" data-plays="1">Black Panther</span> managed to swoop seven Oscar nominations this year, including Best Costume Design, thanks to the incredible designer, Ruth Carter. Having previously been nominated in that category for Malcolm X (1992) and Amistad (1997), Carter is no stranger to the game. Yet she was incredibly anxious to take on this project, Carter jokingly told Netflix’s Abstract, “People say ‘Wow, she designed Black Panther. Tell me how your process is.’ I’m like ‘Oh yeah, I go home and cry in my pillow every night because I’m scared.’”
<br>
</br>
Even though, T’Challa’s (Chadwick Boseman) Panther outfit designed by his genius little sister (Letitia Wright) is too technologically advanced to actually exist, that does not stop us from wishing it did. The sleek black and silver combination made crime fighting look better than ever. The fashion in Black Panther has all the elements of African style, ranging from colorful textiles and prints to <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/black-panther-designer-ruth-carter-reveals-the-african-symbols-embedded-in-the-costumes"target="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/black-panther-designer-ruth-carter-reveals-the-african-symbols-embedded-in-the-costumes">symbols from all over the continent</a>.
<br>
</br>
The clothing is one of the best aspects of this film and without Carter’s stellar way of blending traditional African fashion with a contemporary vibe, Black Panther would not be the same. Besides the cool fighting sequences, breathtaking landscapes, and Michael B. Jordan’s beautiful face, the costumes in this Best Picture nominee surely steal the show.
<br>
</br>
And the Award for Best Outfit goes to…
<br>
</br>
The Wakandan Queen herself, Ramonda (Angela Bassett). The 3D-printed hat and shoulder piece, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/waltercallens/6472637539/in/pool-affriccann"target="https://www.flickr.com/photos/waltercallens/6472637539/in/pool-affriccann">inspired by traditional Zulu hats</a>, complete the authoritative and fearless look Bassett portrays in the movie.

<p>
Although it’s the worst rated film in Rotten Tomatoes out of all the other nominees, it’s definitely one of the highest ranked in costume design in our list. Freddie Mercury (played by Rami Malek) is not only one of the androgynous icons of all time, he is also responsible for history’s most popular looks. From his drag look in the music video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ"target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ">I Want to Break Free</a>, to his <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/99008891793341677/"target="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/99008891793341677/">harlequin catsuit</a>, and his simple <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/276197389635165369/"target="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/276197389635165369/">Live Aid outfit</a>, iconic is the first word that comes to mind when I think of not only his clothes but his footprint in pop culture as well.
<br>
</br>
Mercury became a legend because of his incomparable personality and out-of-this-world vocals. Also, because of his eccentric, over the top wardrobe that made everyone back in the 70s (and now) wonder how a man can pull of any and every outfit. Julian Day (Nowhere Boy, Control), the film’s costume designer, <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/bohemian-rhapsody-costume-designer-interview"target="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/bohemian-rhapsody-costume-designer-interview">told Vogue</a>, “I don’t think Freddie Mercury ever followed fashion as such.” Day captured Mercury’s flamboyance perfectly; he even <a href="https://www.crfashionbook.com/celebrity/a24123310/bohemian-rhapsodys-costume-julian-day-interview/"target="https://www.crfashionbook.com/celebrity/a24123310/bohemian-rhapsodys-costume-julian-day-interview/">borrowed clothes from Queen’s very own Brian May</a>.
<br>

Freddie Mercury (duh!) in this Zandra Rhodes’s <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/freddie-mercury-queen-bohemian-rhapsody-zandra-rhodes"target="https://www.vogue.com/article/freddie-mercury-queen-bohemian-rhapsody-zandra-rhodes">butterfly wedding top</a>. Even though it is in the film for a brief moment, it became one of the staple pieces of rock ’n’ roll history.

<h3>BlacKkKlansman (dir. Spike Lee):</h3>
<p>
Spike Lee’s latest joint not only got a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-spike-lees-blackkklansman-draws-10-minute-ovation-1111550"target="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-spike-lees-blackkklansman-draws-10-minute-ovation-1111550">10 minute standing ovation</a> but also won the <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2018/05/19/cannes-2018-winners-spike-lee-blackkklansman-shoplifters/"target="https://ew.com/movies/2018/05/19/cannes-2018-winners-spike-lee-blackkklansman-shoplifters/">Grand Prix at Cannes</a>. BlacKkKlansman tells the true story of the first African American man, Ron Stallworth (played by John David Washington) to join the Colorado Springs Police Department as a detective for infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. Even though it is not a period piece, it is set in the 70s and costume designer Marci Rodgers (The Day Shall Come, She’s Gotta Have It reboot) stayed authentic to the time period.
<br>
</br>
To dress Stallworth, Rodgers had his memoir as reference. "But I was able, thankfully, to have a conversation with him about what he felt made him, you know, jazzy when he went undercover," Rodgers told <a href="https://fashionista.com/2018/08/blackkklansman-movie-costumes"target="https://fashionista.com/2018/08/blackkklansman-movie-costumes">Fashionista</a>. His wardrobe included vibrant prints, and eye-catching colors and textures.
<br>
</br>
Since Lee based Patrice (Laura Harrier) on brave women from the Black Power Movement and other civil rights activists, like former Black Panther member Kathleen Cleaver and political activist Angela Davis. Both activists wore turtlenecks, knee-high boots and long dark jackets and their natural afros, as does Patrice in the film.
<br>
</br>
And the Award for Best Outfit goes to…
<br>
</br>
Both Ron Stallworth and Patrice Dumas! In the picture below, Patrice is sporting her signature outfit, black turtleneck and a long black jacket with a pin containing a political message. Ron is wearing what I think is his best outfit in the film (besides <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/577516352195117984/"target="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/577516352195117984/">the terracotta jacket</a>), a Nike sweater over a red turtleneck and a vintage denim jacket to complete the look.

Like many of the costume designers for the films nominated for Best Picture, Betsy Heimann (Pulp Fiction, Almost Famous) found inspiration in the real-life people the actors portrayed. Every musician back in the 1960s was a sharp dresser, and pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) was no exception. Heimann had to concoct two aesthetics for two different people who were complete opposites. Dr. Shirley had impeccable style, wearing pattern sweaters, tailored suits, and using his wardrobe to make a statement.
<br>
</br>
“His clothes are kind of a shield, where he’s thinking ‘I don’t care how you feel about black people, look at me. I’m beautifully attired, I’m well educated, I’ve got good taste and you can tell that from a mile away,’” Heimann told the Motion Picture Association of America.
<br>
</br>
On the other hand, Tony ‘Lip’ (Viggo Mortensen) was an Italian, working class man who wore tight, conservative clothing. Heimann had the opportunity of having Tony’s family work on the movie; they would loan the actors Tony and Dolores’s actual jewelry. “They’d look in the mirror and they’d go, ‘Yeah, my dad would’ve worn this. This is good,’” she said. By the end of the film, after Dr. Shirley and Tony were finally friends, their clothing blended together.

<h3>Roma (dir. Alfonso Cuarón):</h3>
<p>
Director Alfonso Cuarón’s autobiographical <span class="soundcite" data-id="287574957" data-start="14000" data-end="35000" data-plays="1"> love letter to Mexico </span> showcased 1970s Mexican clothing for two different social classes. Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) is a housekeeper for a family so she wears a lot of skirts, ballerina flats, and occasionally, an apron. Sofia (Marina de Tavira), the mother of the family wears office appropriate clothing around the house, like blouses and pencil skirts. Even the kids wore a lot of sweaters and polo-shirts with dress trousers.
<br>
</br>
The Academy Award winning director gave costume designer, Anna Terrazas (Europa Report, Get the Gringo), pictures of his mother. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-alfonso-cuaron-painstakingly-created-his-youth-roma-1156147"target="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-alfonso-cuaron-painstakingly-created-his-youth-roma-1156147">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, since the film is black and white, sometimes the clothes had to be dyed a hue lighter or darker to get the contrast Cuarón wanted.

<h3>Vice (dir. Adam McKay):</h3>
<p>
Vice’s costume designer, Susan Matheson (The Big Short, Friday Night Lights), had the challenge of not only handling former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney’s (Christian Bale) 100+ costume changes but also making sure the clothes progressed through time and space with the character. The film covers different time periods of Cheney’s life and several of his body transformation. Also, the President, Vice President and their families represent a nation, so it’s important for them to look sharp and graceful.
<br>
</br>
As for Lynne Cheney (Amy Adams), some of her costumes were specifically made for the film. According to Ikon London Magazine, Matheson said “The essence of Lynne Cheney once she arrived in Washington D.C. is the lady suit with a broach or a necklace. She wore her own versions of the power suit and they were quite colorful.” Luckily, Cheney’s life was heavily documented as well as the lives of those around him, so Matheson had a lot of material to pull from.
